Improvement:
 - Allow you to choose an avatar in the options screen, so that each time you connect, you look the same (can opt out by clearing your avatar in options).
 - Vibrate during countdown to a multiplayer game. For those lonely times where you're waiting in the lobby for others to join, and want to be notified when others are present.
