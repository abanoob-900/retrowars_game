Critical bug fix:

v0.6.0 crashes instantly every time. This was due to a change in Gradle tooling.
Thanks to everyone who reported this issue, and especially to those on the Unciv
GitHub (including those from the F-Droid team) who identified the problem and
the solution.

Please support further development via Liberapay or GitHub Sponsors.
