Space invaders: Improve enemy spawning. Prefer to fill in all blank spaces between the alien flanks before extending further out.

Prior to this, players who were successfully containing the flanks (an important strategy in succeeding in space invaders according to some)
would quickly have this advantage wiped out from the smallest of enemy attacks.
