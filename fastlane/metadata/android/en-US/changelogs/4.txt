Improvements:
 * Additional controller layouts to choose from (thanks for the idea MrLatebros)
 * Much more robust multiplayer networking all round (ensure clearer separation of the network + UI thread)
 * Snake starts from bottom of screen to allow more time to think at the start of the game

Please feel free to provide feedback so we can make this as fun as can be.
